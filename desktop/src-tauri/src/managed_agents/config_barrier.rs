//! The boot config barrier: gather every coordinate, decide, enforce.
//!
//! This is the entry point that makes [`super::decision::decide`] mean
//! something. It runs once per boot, before the flush loop can publish, and
//! wires the three layers together in the order V3.4 requires:
//!
//! 1. enumerate the coordinates this device knows about, from disk;
//! 2. run every relay lookup with NO store lock held;
//! 3. take `managed_agents_store_lock` once, re-check the scope, gather the
//!    local half, decide, and enforce — all under that single guard.
//!
//! # Why the barrier exists
//!
//! Without it, boot re-signs local disk content at
//! `monotonic_created_at = max(now, head + 1)` and queues it for publish. A
//! store that is merely stale therefore mints events that are strictly newer
//! than the edits they revert, and the relay's last-write-wins resolution
//! adopts the revert. The barrier's job is to run BEFORE that publish and
//! decide, per coordinate, whether the local content is an edit worth
//! publishing or a stale copy that must be suppressed.
//!
//! # What it enforces, and what it does not
//!
//! It enforces exactly one thing: the publication gate
//! ([`super::config_sync::apply_gate`]). A coordinate whose decision blocks
//! publication is withheld from [`super::retention::get_pending_sync`] and
//! cannot reach the relay on this boot. Decisions that PATCH disk
//! (`ApplyHead`, `RestoreFromRelay`, `DeleteLocal`) are logged and gated but
//! not applied here — applying them is the resolution path (V3.6), which is
//! user-driven by design. Suppression is the half that stops the data loss;
//! adopting remote content is the half that needs a human.
